        <p class="heading">From Jake's partner in crime to decorated Starfleet officer.</p>
        <p><b>IN THE BEGINNING:</b> Helping out at his uncle, Quark's, bar is how Nog spent most of his time. He
            was a traditional Ferengi - profit was the only goal in life, and <i>HU-mons</i> were to be avoided when
            possible. When the Cardassians left Terok Nor, what became Deep Space Nine, it created an influx of
            Federation citizens and adventurers to the station and Quark’s Bar.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nog became friends with young Jake Sisko, the son of the new station commander. They spent their time
            goofing off and getting into mischief. Nog’s friendship with Jake exposed him to Starfleet personnel on
            a regular basis. Nog learned more about humans, and started going to the station school despite his
            father, Rom’s, warning him to stay away from the Federation and <i>HU-mons</i>.

                </p>
            </div>
            <p><b> A BOLD CHOICE:</b> Despite his family’s animosity toward the Federation, Nog decided to apply
                for
                the Starfleet academy. Commander Sisko put Nog through a series of tests to gauge whether Nog was
                serious. Sisko saw how dedicated Nog was and personally recommended him for the academy.</p>
            <p>
                While at the academy, Nog is drafted to help Benjamin Sisko during an attack on Earth that is a part of
                an attempted coup to undermine the Federation president.
            </p>

            <p>His sophomore year, Nog returned to Deep Space Nine and roomed with Jake. But being roommates almost
                ended
                their friendship because of their similarity, conflicting
                personal habits. Nog and Jake clashed and ended up in the brig on trumped-up charges, so the boys' were
                forced to mend their friendship.

                    <b>FIRST FERENGI IN STARFLEET:</b> As a cadet, Nog was thrust into the thick of things as the
                    Dominion
                    War was raging. Commander Sisko trusted Nog and relied on his unique skills during many missions.
                    Nog
                    used his acute hearing to relay messages between engineering and the bridge when the communications
                    were
                    down on the Defiant. At one point, Nog's Ferengi know-how came in handy when he was able to get a
                    vital
                    piece of equipment for the Defiant by making a number of backroom deals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the Cardassians join the Dominion and retook Terok Nor/Deep Space Nine, Nog had to leave his
                    family
                    behind on the station and fight with Starfleet. At one point, the Defiant lost communications and
                    Nog,
                    with his superior hearing, acted as a living intercom.
                </p>

        <p>
            <b>THE FOG OF WAR:</b> Nog got promoted to ensign and was a regular crew member of the Defiant. On a
            mission to resupply the solders protecting a recently captured Dominion communication array, Nog was
            asked, once again, to use his acute hearing to scout for Jem'Hadar solders approaching their position
            while the team defended their position. The ensign was shot when his scouting party got cut off from
            their escape route. Nog was injured and lost his leg.
        </p>
        <p>
            To keep up morale during the tense wait for the Jem'Hadar to attack, Julian played “I’ll be seeing you”
            from a recording by the holosuite character Vic Fontaine. As Nog laid there hurt and barely conscious,
            he heard the haunting music juxtaposed with his friends fighting, and dying, to defend their position.
        </p>

        <div id="section-three">

                alt="Nog with Vic in his appartment">
            <p><i>Nog helps Vic with his books.</i>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            While Nog got a biosynthetic leg and returned to the station to recuperate, he suffered from severe
            PTSD. Nog insisted on using a cane, even though the doctors said he was completely healed. Nog's loved
            ones were worried he wouldn’t mentally recover and tried different things to cheer him up, only to push
            him farther into his depression.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, Nog went to the holosuite to ask the hologram, Vic Fontaine, to sing "I'll Be Seeing You" for
            him. Vic sung the song in every way he could think of. Finally, Nog asked Vic if he could stay with him
            in his holographic apartment.
        </p>

        <p id="stop-three">
            Vic humored Nog and took him under his wing, letting him help in the holosuite club. Nog got into a
            groove in the club, donning a tux and helping customers. Eventually, Nog gained his confidence back and
            forgot to use his cane.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nog seemed ready to leave the holosuite and go back to his family and friends, but he tells Vic he wants
            to stay there forever. When Vic asks why, Nog tells him it’s because after being injured, he realized
            that he could die out there in the real world. Vic told Nog he would die slowly in the holographic world
            and fade away if he didn’t face his life. He reminded Nog that everyone dies, but it’s how you lived
            that is important.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nog realized Vic was right and returned to his life and his grateful family. Once completely healed, Nog
            was once again a crew member of the Defiant fighting to defeat the Dominion. After the war, he stayed on
            with Deep Space Nine under Kira's command. Nog was promoted to lieutenant junior grade by Sisko's as one
            of his last acts as commander.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nog proved over and over again that he had heart: from a busboy to a war hero.
